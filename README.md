### Support:
For support, we can try our best in helping to the best we can. We worked hard on our project and take pride in it, but we could always further polish up our own code or help others be better with theirs.

### Roadmap:
We believe that we have done what we could utilizing Java to create the game of Spelunky. Nearly all of the base game's system was imported and created in our own way, and the only way we could continue working on the game is to maybe fix some minor bugs or to implement entirely new concepts of our own. Maybe some day if we have time we'll come back and polish the project up. 

### Contributing:

Though we hold no credit to creating the Spelunky game idea, if anyone is interested in modifying our code for their own purposes then by all means feel free to do so.

### Acknowledgement:

The assets and music utilized in this project were all produced by the talented minds at Mossmouth, LLC. Without their hard work and inspiration, our game could never have been dreamnt up and created, nor would we hold a special place in our hearts of lazy afternoons relaxing while playing their game. Special thanks to Mr. David in being the best teacher we could've had, and as a guide in assisting us in our code.
